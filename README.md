# iTask - Todo App

**iTask** is a clean, responsive, and intuitive Todo app built with **React**.  
It helps you stay organized and boost productivity by managing your daily tasks with ease.

Unlike typical todo apps, **iTask** leverages modern React features like `useReducer` for structured state management and `react-hook-form` for seamless form handling.  
Your tasks are automatically saved using `localStorage`, so you’ll never lose your progress — even after a page refresh.
